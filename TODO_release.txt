Things to do in preparation for a release:

    - the encoding broke termdetect under tmux (it now hangs...  the change that triggered the problem is
                7560c04)

    - rewrite README.md to be much more end-user oriented...
            - show how to install the latest-greatest terminfo.src from ncurses, just in their home directory
            - strongly encourage them to do that ^^^

    - EAT YOUR OWN DOG FOOD

        - have some sort of fallback mechanism to try progressively less-precise apprxoimations of
          the suggested $TERM setting,   falling back whenever the current system doesn't support
          a particular $TERM

                - while we strongly suggest that the user install the full ncurses terminfo, this is
                  something that many users may not want to do (at least not right away), so we shouldn't
                  make it mandatory

        - change the 'termdetect -t' argument to be 'termdetect -e' (for "env"), 
            and have it include a setting for $LANG

                    - but ONLY if the character coding was detected -- trying to make a new locale is...
                      complicated enough that it'll have to wait until the next release

                    - I don't know if  Encode::Locale  could help with this at all?

    - on release:

        - distribute it somewhat widely:
                - post it on Facebook
                - post it on reddit.com/r/commandline
                - email Eads
                - email Bec
                - email the person that made ncurses, ask them if they know of anybody who would
                  find this useful

- try to address some of the "variance" issues

- find an install of Perl v5.6.2 to test this against, to see if it will run even on old Perls
            (building it via PerlBrew has failed on two of my machines so far)

- add more terminals to the termmatch database, particularly some OS/X ones

- see if I can detect more character encodings

- if we generate a locale that doesn't yet exist locally  (ie. it's in `locale -m` but not `locale -a`),
  then use either localedef(1) or locale-gen(1) to create one
        - creating locales is...  kind of complicated :|
