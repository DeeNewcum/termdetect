Things to do in preparation for a release:

    - rewrite README.md to be much more end-user oriented...
        (give good examples of how to integrate it into .bashrc and .vimrc)

    - EAT YOUR OWN DOG FOOD

        - change the 'termdetect -t' argument to be 'termdetect -e' (for "env"), 
            and have it include a setting for $LANG

                    - but ONLY if the character coding was detected -- trying to make a new locale is...
                      complicated enough that it'll have to wait until the next release

                    - I don't know if  Encode::Locale  could help with this at all?

    - on release:

        - distribute it somewhat widely:
                - post it on Facebook
                - post it on reddit.com/r/commandline
                - email Eads
                - email Bec
                - email the person that made ncurses, ask them if they know of anybody who would
                  find this useful

#################################[ v0.12 ]######################################
################################################################################

- improve the contents of t/
        (see TODO_testing.txt)

- try to address some of the "variance" issues

- find an install of Perl v5.6.2 to test this against, to see if it will run even on old Perls
            (building it via PerlBrew has failed on two of my machines so far)

- add more terminals to the termmatch database, particularly some OS/X ones

- see if I can detect more character encodings

- if we generate a locale that doesn't yet exist locally  (ie. it's in `locale -m` but not `locale -a`),
  then use either localedef(1) or locale-gen(1) to create one
        - creating locales is...  kind of complicated :|
