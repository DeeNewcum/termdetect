Things to do in preparation for a release:

- EAT YOUR OWN DOG FOOD

- set the number of colors correctly...   we *shouldn't* hard-code 256 colors in 
    ~/.vimrc, because that breaks when we don't have 256 colors
    (eg. in Linux Console [16] or urxvt [88])

            - terminfo.ncurses doesn't have a 256 variant for:
                    - SecureCRT
                    - tmux      (which terminfo.ncurses reads as "xterm-new")

- on release:

    - distribute it somewhat widely:
            - post it on Facebook
            - post it on reddit.com/r/commandline
            - email Eads
            - email Bec
            - email the person that made ncurses, ask them if they know of anybody who would
              find this useful

- change the 'termdetect -t' argument to be 'termdetect -e' (for "env"), 
    and have it include a setting for $LANG

            - but ONLY if the character coding was detected -- trying to make a new locale is...
              complicated enough that it'll have to wait until the next release

            - I don't know if  Encode::Locale  could help with this at all?

            - add a good example to README.md of how to integrate termdetect into
              .vimrc

#################################[ v0.13 ]######################################
################################################################################

- add the ability to have "suffixes" on terminal names
    - these suffixes would be entirely confined to termdetect; once the terminal was going
      to be used for terminfo, the suffix would be removed
    - the suffix is only to keep track of unique termmatch entries (eg. because of version variations),
      but for which those minor differences ONLY matter to termdetect, and don't matter to terminfo
    - one example where we need this already is  screen_4.00.02  vs  screen_4.00.03jw4,
      where the terminfo entry is just   screen
            - note: terminfo.ncurses already does this...  it uses the "+" character for internal-only purposes

- improve the contents of t/
        (see t/TODO.txt)

- try to address some of the "variance" issues
    see TODO_variance.txt

- try to address some of the "ambiguous" issues
    see TODO_ambiguous.txt

- find an install of Perl v5.6.2 to test this against, to see if it will run even on old Perls
            (building it via PerlBrew has failed on two of my machines so far)

- add more terminals to the termmatch database, particularly some OS/X ones

- see if I can detect more character encodings

- if we generate a locale that doesn't yet exist locally  (ie. it's in `locale -m` but not `locale -a`),
  then use either localedef(1) or locale-gen(1) to create one
        - creating locales is...  kind of complicated :|
