Things to do in preparation for a release:

- promotion
    - it doesn't look like there's any way to do an image-tracker or any sort of analytics on the
      main github page...   Perhaps we'll put off developing a nice gh-pages page until later?
            - ask Eads for advice...  he's done a lot of analytics, and will know the value of that
            - also, he may have some other suggestions for OSS promotion

- on release:

    - distribute it somewhat widely:
            - post it here:  http://serverfault.com/questions/350401/detect-terminal-type-with-tput
            - post it on Freshmeat
            - post it on http://opencode.us/
            - post it on Facebook
            - post it on reddit.com/r/commandline
            - email Eads
            - email Bec
            - email the person that made ncurses, ask them if they know of anybody who would
              find this useful
            - more ideas:
                    - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/95710/how-do-you-promote-advertise-evangelize-your-open-source-project
                    - http://gsoc-wiki.osuosl.org/index.php/Promoting_Your_Open_Source_Project
                    - listen to Tribes by Seth Godin    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/95710/how-do-you-promote-advertise-evangelize-your-open-source-project/441859#441859
                    - ask Eads how to get a few initial eyeballs

- point out in the manual or somewhere that if the user wants to customize termmatch.src,
    they have to download their own copy and modify that, rather than starting with a blank file

- find a version of FreeBSD to test this on

- (maybe)  should we implement a "canonical name" feature, distinct from the suggested $TERM?
  While one of our obvious use-cases is suggesting a $TERM value, there ARE other use-cases, and
  those may be interested in triggering off of a more stable name

- [usability/polish]  sporadic failures happen when the user types something exactly when
            termdetect is running.  While this happens maybe 0.5 - 1.0% of the time, it would
            be good to deal with this in a better way.

                    - if we can't recover, we should at the bare minimum print a one-line
                      warning on STDERR    (so that when they see this while .bashrc is running,
                      they at least get the heads-up ASAP that they should log back in)

                    - see Github Issue #3 for thoughts on possible ways to recover

- (maybe)  add a CHANGES file, akin to this project:
            http://cwrapper.sourceforge.net/

- change the 'termdetect -t' argument to be 'termdetect -e' (for "env"), 
    and have it include a setting for $LANG

            - but ONLY if the character coding was detected -- trying to make a new locale is...
              complicated enough that it'll have to wait until the next release

            - I don't know if  Encode::Locale  could help with this at all?

            - add a good example to README.md of how to integrate termdetect into
              .vimrc

- integrate the termping functionality directly into termdetect --ping.  The reasoning for this:
        1. the more info we pack into the default screen, the more impressive this program is
        2. we want the program to be as easy to install as possible, and having two separate
           programs makes it much harder to install

- should we create a slightly more streamlined way to install the terminfo file, other
    than the mktemp/.../rm method that's currently suggested?

- add the ability to have "suffixes" on terminal names
    - these suffixes would be entirely confined to termdetect; once the terminal was going
      to be used for terminfo, the suffix would be removed
    - the suffix is only to keep track of unique termmatch entries (eg. because of version variations),
      but for which those minor differences ONLY matter to termdetect, and don't matter to terminfo
    - one example where we need this already is  screen_4.00.02  vs  screen_4.00.03jw4,
      where the terminfo entry is just   screen
            - note: terminfo.ncurses already does this...  it uses the "+" character for internal-only purposes

- improve the contents of t/
        (see t/TODO.txt)

- try to address some of the "variance" issues
    see TODO_variance.txt

- try to address some of the "ambiguous" issues
    see TODO_ambiguous.txt

- find an install of Perl v5.6.2 to test this against, to see if it will run even on old Perls
            (building it via PerlBrew has failed on two of my machines so far)

- add more terminals to the termmatch database

- see if I can detect more character encodings

- if we generate a locale that doesn't yet exist locally  (ie. it's in `locale -m` but not `locale -a`),
  then use either localedef(1) or locale-gen(1) to create one
        - creating locales is...  kind of complicated :|

- on release:
    - consider learning how to make it available as a Debian package:
