I use the term "ambiguous" to mean a very specific thing -- when one escape-code  (or one
encoded-character) gets interpretted by two different terminals as two very different things.

This can a serious problem if one of the two meanings has serious side-effects.

    (this is reminiscent of how ISA cards used to be configured back in the day...  hardware would
     probed for auto-detection, but if you tried to test for card A at IRQ 7, but card B was
     there instead, sometimes this probing would cause a system crash because the probe meant
     something VERY different, depending on what card was there
