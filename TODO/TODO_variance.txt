These are issues where we have an existing fingerprint for a terminal, but we later discover
it isn't 100% correct because:
        1) testing on a different version of the terminal results in a different fingerprint, or:
        2) merely using different settings results in a different fingerprint


==== putty, m_c1 ====
    
On the standard Ubuntu 12.04 install, it gives "%x+3".  

Both versions show as v0.62, so it *might* be a settings problem...?


==== xterm ====

Xterm on Ubuntu 12.04 compared to Solaris 10 seems fairly different.  Are these completely different
codebases?  I can't seem to get any sort of version number from the Solaris xterm...


==== SecureCRT ====

SecureCRT changes its behavior SIGNIFICANTLY based on the Terminal > Emulation > Terminal setting
