========================================[ unit testing ]========================================

- terminfo parser -- we need to test to make sure that when duplicate terminal names are used,
  that the parser errors out on this    (I think it maybe doesn't currently)

- a decent percentage of the bugs so far have been related to the terminfo parser....  it would
  be good to write more unit tests for it


================================[ integration testing, automated ]=================================

- do some automated testing across terminals....   A lot of terminals can be opened with a specific
  command to run:

        konsole --workdir $PWD -e bash -c './termdetect > /tmp/o; read';  sleep 2;  cat /tmp/o

        gnome-terminal -x bash -c './termdetect > /tmp/o; read';  cat /tmp/o

        pterm -e bash -c './termdetect > /tmp/o; read';  cat /tmp/o

        xterm -e bash -c './termdetect > /tmp/o; read';  cat /tmp/o

        rxvt -e bash -c './termdetect > /tmp/o; read';  cat /tmp/o

        urxvt -e bash -c './termdetect > /tmp/o; read';  cat /tmp/o

        aterm -e bash -c './termdetect > /tmp/o; read';  sleep 1;  cat /tmp/o

        mrxvt -e bash -c './termdetect > /tmp/o; read';  cat /tmp/o

        screen bash -c './termdetect > /tmp/o; read';  clear;  cat /tmp/o
        
        tmux new-session "bash -c './termdetect > /tmp/o; read'";  cat /tmp/o

        mosh -- localhost bash -c "$PWD/termdetect > /tmp/o; read"; cat /tmp/o


        in SecureCRT, the only way to do it is to create a new Session specically for this test,
                and then specify the command in:   Connection > Logon Actions > Remote Command


- is there any way we can do the cross-terminal testing (designed to catch problems that are termed
  "ambiguous") on one of the hosted-testing sites?

    - Travis-CI
        - they allow ubuntu packages to be installed, as well as third-party PPAs

    - EC2?  They're pretty cheap, and I'd like a little experience using them.
            - OS's you can run on ECR2 include:   Linux (various), FreeBSD, Windows (various),
            - OS/X won't run on EC2 due to hardware licensing issues
            - Ubuntu Cloud-Init looks awwwwesome

- do more testing!
