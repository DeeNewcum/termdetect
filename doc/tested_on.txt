termdetect requires only a base install of Perl, and it has been tested on a
wide variety of Perls and operating systems.

Perl versions it has been tested on include:
    - Perl v5.8.6
    - Perl v5.10.1
    - Perl v5.14.2

Operating systems it has been tested on include:
    - Ubuntu 10.10 and 12.04
    - RHEL 5
    - Solaris 10
    - OS/X 10.8

Termdetect is also expected to work on FreeBSD, AIX, and HPUX, but it hasn't
been tested on those yet.

If there are any problems running on different versions of Perl or Un*x, I'm
interested in having bug reports filed for these.
