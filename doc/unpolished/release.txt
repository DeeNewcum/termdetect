Things to do to do a release:


- Eat your own dogfood -- TEST THE VERSION ON YOUR OWN COMPUTERS for a day or three before
  releasing it, to ensure there weren't any last-minute breakages. 

- update the $VERSION at the top of src/termdetect

- do all this:
    git checkout release
    git merge master
    cd src; make
    cp termdetect.fatpacked ../release/termdetect
    git add ../release/termdetect
    git commit 
    git push origin release
    git checkout master

- check that the new version actually shows up at http://is.gd/termdetect
