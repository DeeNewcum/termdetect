==== possible encodings ====

There are a LOT of them.  Do we want to limit the list in any way?



A LOT of encodings are single-byte.  This sucks.  When there's a 1-to-1 mapping between number of
characters sent, and the number of positions the cursor moves, that means it's hard/impossible for
us to detect that encoding via cursor movement detection.


==== variable-width encodings ====

There are a few of these.

==== multi-byte encodings ====

==== other things that could affect the input-bytes/cursor-movement ratio ====


    ---- character that are double-wide ----

    ---- characters that don't move the cursor at all ----

                I don't know if there are any of these outside of unicode??

                Does this exist outside of Unicode??
