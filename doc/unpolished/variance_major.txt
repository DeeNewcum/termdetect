"Variance" means any test that the terminal responds to differently, based on its internal settings.
To use, it naively looks like it's multiple unique terminals.


==== Konsole ====

- it DOES support VT52 mode



==== Putty ====

- Putty responds to the DECSCL sequence, and it looks like it *greatly* changes how it responds to
  other sequences based on that

        - in its source code, see terminal.c, and search for "compatibility"
