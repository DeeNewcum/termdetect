The following are possible [user scenarios](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenario_%28computing%29).  They are listed here to try to help determine what kinds of output the program should produce.

## Single exception

The user accesses her main server from several different computers, using different terminals.  Most of the time, the server's settings are good, but there is one terminal that she uses that she wants to tweak slightly.  Either it doesn't support something the others do, or it's the one standout that supports a nice feature that none of the others do.

How she uses this information is up to her â€” she might set the shell prompt differently, or change an environment variable that triggers a corresponding change in her .vimrc, etc.  All she wants is a way to identify the one outlier.

### Implementation

In this case, she doesn't necessarily need a global database to recognize her terminals.  She just wants to recognize the one, so she uses the "snapshot" function to record the one outlier, and tags it with her own custom name.


## Single exception, already in the global database

Same as above, but in this case, the one exception she's interested in has already been cataloged by us; we can identify it correctly.

### Implementation

She just needs SOME identifier that uniquely identifies the one outlier.  It doesn't matter what it is, we can totally make it up if we want.


## The results of one test

The user just wants to know whether the current terminal supports one capability.  She doesn't want or need to run a bunch of tests, she's just interested in one.  For instance, she wants to know if the current terminal is able to set the window title (or, at the very least, won't display garbled stuff to the user if you try).

### Implementation

If there's a specific test that termdetect has, we can just run that one test and return the results.  If there's NOT a test, then we'd have to do the complicated 1) run all termdetect tests, 2) find a matching terminfo entry, 3) look for that specific capability within that terminfo entry.  But that's much more complicated, so we'd like to provide the shortcut to the user if possible, because it's faster and more reliable.


## Match a bundled terminfo database

The user uses many different computers, and doesn't trust the local terminfo files because they vary so much across machines.  So she puts termdetect in her [centralized dotfile repo](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=dotfiles&repo=&langOverride=&start_value=1&type=Repositories&language=), and asks termdetect to choose the most appropriate terminfo file for the specific terminal, whenever she logs in.

### Implementation

There are two possible ways:

1. when we look in our database to find a matching terminal, the terminal-IDs will be the same as the bundled terminfo database
2. we maintain a separate mapping from our terminal-ID to the appropriate bundled terminfo database name

We would probably use both options: The first when an individual terminal has its own dedicated entry in the terminfo database, and the second when the best terminfo entry is a generic entry that works for multiple terminals.

Termdetect would accomplish this by setting the [$TERMINFO environment variable](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Text-Terminal-HOWTO-16.html).


## Match an external terminfo database

The user doesn't want to use the terminfo database that's bundled with our program, instead she wants to use her local OS's terminfo database.

### Implementation
