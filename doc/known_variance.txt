"Variance" indicates situations where one terminal can have multiple fingerprints (either between
different versions, or due to settings changes)


========================================[ version variance ]========================================

- SecureCRT v6.7.2 vs v7.0.2
        run this:   uperl -le 'print "\x{1031e}"'
        in v6.7.2, it displays as a single character
        in v7.0.2, it reads the 4-byte utf8 sequence as a 3-byte sequence, followed by an 0x9E,
                which causes it to eat the following escape sequence

                
========================================[ settings variance ]========================================

- Xterm has many different settings, including command-line settings:
                -ti vt52            start in VT52 mode
                -ti vt102           start in VT102 mode
                -ti vt220           start in VT220 mode
                -wc and -u8         enable/disable processing of UTF-8 characters
        and resource settings:
                allowColorOps       allowed to set/query color information?
                allowFontOps        allowed to set/query font information?
                allowScrollLock     allowed to set/query the scroll-lock information?
                allowSendEvents     holy fuck, big security hole
                allowTcapOps        allowed to query termcap-related info?
                allowTitleOps       allowed to set/query the title?
                allowWindowOps      allow escape sequences to control the window
                answerbackString    sets the response for ENQ  (defaults to "")
                autoWrap            
                cjkWidth
                combiningChars

                limitResize
                mkWidth
                reverseWrap
