other ideas for terminal detection:

- try to detect whether specific features are supported

        - ones that can be detected by using the cursor-position query

            - enable line wrap (<ESC>[7h) and disable line wrap (<ESC>[7l)

            - save cursor, and restore

            - save cursor and attributes, and restore

            - set tab;  clear tab;  clear all tabs

            - vertical tabs

            - change scroll region

            - right-to-left mode

            - alternate screen

            - support for Unicode combining characters

            - support for double-width Unicode characters

- look for specific bugs, or for different results in response to undefined behavior in the spec
        (much like browser sniffing)


- specify terminal strings in a generic way
        (terminfo!)
                `infocmp -L -1`
