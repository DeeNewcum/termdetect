- with rxvt-unicode, there is uningested data that gets dumped out at the command-line afterwards...
  we need to figure out what's going on here

        - it appears to be happening on the 'm_sub' test



==== command-line argument processing ====

    - by default (when the -t flag isn't used, etc), display more information:
            - the matching $TERM
            - the version  (if available)
            - the stuff listed below:
                - current character encoding
                - current font size
                - current screen size
                - current window title



- create a flag that enables "show me the results of a single test" mode, where it doesn't try
  to do term-matching, but rather gives the output of a single test.

  In the documentation, note that useful tests to use this with are:

            - current character encoding

            - current terminal size
                    (use Term::ReadKey::GetTerminalSize())
                    (or see "TIOCGWINSZ" in the source for IO::Tty)

            - current font size   (only available if the terminal supports getting the terminal size in pixels)

            - current screen size
                    - this requires some estimation, based on the font size
                    - note that most computer screens are either 4:3 or 16:9.
                                (16:10 can go jump off a cliff)
                      If you play around with the math a little, you realize you can just round
                      the width to the nearest 20, and the height to the nearest 15, and you'll 
                      probably be spot-on)



==== random stuff ====

- could we test against DOS's ANSI.SYS?  This is mostly for homorous value, it's not really useful
  at all.  But ANSI.SYS *does* support the \e[6n (Device Status Report -- Cursor), so this code
  *should* mostly work.     http://helppc.netcore2k.net/misc/ansi-codes
