- add request/reply sequences for:

    - save+restore cursor

    - scrolling region

    - horizontal tabs   (set, clear, etc)

    - alternate-screen

    - the Xterm reporting features listed in:
            vttest:     11 non-VT100,  8 XTERM,  2 test reporting functions,  2 DECRQM/DECRPM

    - double-width mode

    - double-height mode



- figure out what the goal-line is here...   what is the output we want to generate when the program finishes running?

        - output some identifier indicating what terminal we're on?

        - try to match to the current machine's terminfo database

        - try to GENERATE a customized terminfo file, specifically for the current terminal?



- figure out how to actually do the terminal matching...   some of the replies are more variable...
  do we want to do regexp matches for some of the fields?

    - figure out what format to use for the database




- once we get cmdline argument processing working, we need to add a --nose flag
  (for "no side-effects").  This flag would disable tests that have any sort of side-effects.
  Of the tests we've included so far, these include:
        - visual bell  (\eg)
        - changing the window title     (two tests do this)
