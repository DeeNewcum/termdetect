- add the Xterm reporting features listed in:
        vttest:     11 non-VT100,  8 XTERM,  2 test reporting functions,  2 DECRQM/DECRPM


- test the alternate-screen


- change run_test() so that it only sends *one* CPR...   the first CPR should be changed to be
  just a move-to-beginning-of-line


- pick a better name for this...

        - "termdet" and "termdetect" both get very few ghits
