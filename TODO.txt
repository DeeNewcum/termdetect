- with rxvt-unicode, there is uningested data that gets dumped out at the command-line afterwards...
  we need to figure out what's going on here

        - it appears to be happening on the 'm_sub' test



- for terminal entries that don't match up exactly with the $TERM names in the ncurses terminfo,
  we need a way to specify which "fallback" $TERM setting to use, that *does* match ncuses terminfo




- possibly calculate the s_window_size in other ways:
        - Term::ReadKey::GetTerminalSize()
        - see "TIOCGWINSZ" in the source for IO::Tty
        - `stty size`


==== command-line argument processing ====

- in the default (long) display, show:
    - current character encoding



==== random stuff ====

- could we test against DOS's ANSI.SYS?  This is mostly for homorous value, it's not really useful
  at all.  But ANSI.SYS *does* support the \e[6n (Device Status Report -- Cursor), so this code
  *should* mostly work.     http://helppc.netcore2k.net/misc/ansi-codes
