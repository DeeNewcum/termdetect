- the parser doesn't work in Perl v5.8, possibly due to small differences in how the regexp engine works


- once we get cmdline argument processing working:

    - add a -t flag that ONLY outputs the terminal name

    - by default (when the -t flag isn't used, etc), display more information:
            - the matching $TERM
            - the version  (if available)
            - the stuff listed below:
                - current character encoding
                - current font size
                - current screen size
                - current window title

    - add a --nose flag (for "no side-effects").  This flag would disable tests that have any sort
      of side-effects.  Of the tests we've included so far, these include:
            - visual bell  (\eg)
            - changing the window title     (two tests do this)



- create a flag that enables "show methe results of a single test" mode, where it doesn't try
  to do term-matching, but rather gives the output of a single test.

  In the documentation, note that useful tests to use this with are:

            - current character encoding

            - current terminal size
                    (use Term::ReadKey::GetTerminalSize())
                    (or see "TIOCGWINSZ" in the source for IO::Tty)

            - current font size   (only available if the terminal supports getting the terminal size in pixels)

            - current screen size
                    - this requires some estimation, based on the font size
                    - note that most computer screens are either 4:3 or 16:9.
                                (16:10 can go jump off a cliff)
                      If you play around with the math a little, you realize you can just round
                      the width to the nearest 20, and the height to the nearest 15, and you'll 
                      probably be spot-on)
