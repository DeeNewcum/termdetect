- don't do any parsing...   regular normal regexps are just fine


- change run_test() so that it only sends *one* CPR...   the first CPR should be changed to be
  just a move-to-beginning-of-line


- line clearing:
    - once all the tests are over, we should clear the line
    - in run_and_display_test(), we should clear the line before we display the results
