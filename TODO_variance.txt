These are issues where we have an existing termmatch.src entry for a terminal, but we later discover
it isn't 100% correct because:
        1) testing on a different version of the terminal shows different results
                (that prevent matching), or:
        2) merely using different settings shows different results (that prevent matching)

On the standard Ubuntu 12.04 install, it gives "%x+3".  

Both versions show as v0.62, so it *might* be a settings problem...?
