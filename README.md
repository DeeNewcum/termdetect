This project aims to produce a utility that performs various tests on the terminal emulator it's currently attached to, and then looks up in its database of known terminal emulators to guess which the current one is closest to.

That is, we do something akin to [browser sniffing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_sniffing).
