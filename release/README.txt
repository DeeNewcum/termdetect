termdetect -- auto-detect which terminal emulator we're talking to


Installation
============

Copy the 'termdetect' script somewhere in your path.

Copy 'termmatch.src' to the same directory as 'termdetect'.


termdetect requires only a base install of Perl, and nothing else.  It has been tested on a wide
range of Perl versions and Un*x variants.



Terminfo files
==============
You are encouraged to install the full set of terminfo files.  Some OS's come with this by default.
For those that don't, run
        termdetect --help-terminfo
for instructions on how to install it.


Documentation
=============

Run    termdetect --help
