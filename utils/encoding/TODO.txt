It's not clear if more work on the encoding-tests will reveal solutions or not.
There may be a lot of useful things we can do, but I don't have the background knowledge to be able
to know what direction to go in.  So work has been slow-going so far.

- look through the ICU data, see if they'll help me identify which encodings are double-byte and
  which are variable-byte
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Components_for_Unicode

        (the ICU data is used by Perl itself, see: http://perldoc.perl.org/enc2xs.html )


- the chart here:
                http://www.aivosto.com/vbtips/control-characters.html#unicode
  suggests that NBSP (non-breaking space) and SHY (soft hyphen) are special and not found in a ton
  of encodings
